The Neighbors — Coffee & Chapters
Welcome to the digital home of The Neighbors, a cozy community hub based in Ohio. This project is a specialized e-commerce and storytelling platform built to bridge the gap between carefully curated coffee and deeply moving literature.

☕ Project Overview
The Neighbors is designed with a "lo-fi" and "antique" aesthetic, focusing on eye comfort and a slow-living atmosphere. The platform serves as a "Digital Chalkboard" and promotional hub for:

The Brews: A specialized coffee inventory featuring house pours, lattes, and a health-focused "Greenhouse" secret menu.

The Chapters: A curated library of books and zines.

The Atmosphere: A community-driven space that highlights vinyl-spinning listening corners and weekly poetry slams.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router).

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Animations: Framer Motion for micro-interactions and smooth transitions.

Icons: Lucide React.

State Management: React Context API for a persistent, scalable inventory and cart system.

Planned Integration: Supabase for persistent database management of orders and inventory.

✨ Key Features
Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile devices, including landscape orientation support for devices like the Google Pixel 10.

Smart Inventory: A unified data structure that separates coffee-specific details (roast, origin) from book-specific details (author, genre).

Persistent Navigation: A sticky navbar and CTA banner that stay accessible as users scroll through the shop’s story.

Dynamic Cart: A real-time shopping cart that tracks "Ink Points" as part of the "Start a Tab" rewards program.
